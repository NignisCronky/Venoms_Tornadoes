Dear Mr.Lebo

I Request That you Fail Me, Logano Gamba.
I don't 100% understand some of the code, 
and I wasn't able to get it to an acceptable state.
The functionality of this milestone is almost the same as the previous. 
If the project somehow seems like enough to pass that I'd like 
to move on to the next month. However I'm pretty sure their 
is no point in grading this.

Probally seeing you next month
-Logano
